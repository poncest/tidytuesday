# TidyTuesday Contributions

## What is TidyTuesday?

A weekly data visualization challenge from the `R4DS Online Learning Community`. Each week features:
- A new dataset for exploration
- Opportunity to practice data wrangling and visualization
- Engagement with the `#RStats` community
- Supportive environment for learning

> TidyTuesday provides a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their data wrangling and visualization skills. While the dataset will be "tamed," it might need various `R for Data Science` techniques to achieve a truly tidy format.

Key aspects:
- Focus on skill-building with real-world data
- Weekly datasets posted every Monday
- Original article context provided
- Inclusive community welcoming all skill levels
