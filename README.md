## <mark> What is TidyTuesday? </mark>

> Join the `R4DS Online Learning Community` in the weekly `#TidyTuesday` event! We post a raw dataset, a chart, or an article related to that dataset every week and ask you to explore the data. While the dataset will be “tamed,” it will not always be tidy! As such, you might need to apply various `R for Data Science` techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format. ' TidyTuesday' aims to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore others’ work, and connect with the greater `#RStats` community! As such, we encourage everyone of all skills to participate!
>
> Tidy Tuesday intends to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independent of drawing conclusions. While we understand that the two are related, this practice focuses purely on building skills with real-world data.
>
> All data will be posted on the data sets page on Monday. It will include the link to the original article (for context) and the data set.
