## <mark> What is TidyTuesday? </mark>

> Join the `R4DS Online Learning Community` in the weekly `#TidyTuesday` event! Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. While the dataset will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various `R for Data Science` techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format. The goal of `TidyTuesday` is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater `#RStats` community! As such we encourage everyone of all skills to participate!
>
>The intent of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independent of drawing conclusions. While we understand that the two are related, the focus of this practice is purely on building skills with real-world data.
>
> All data will be posted on the data sets page on Monday. It will include the link to the original article (for context) and to the data set.
